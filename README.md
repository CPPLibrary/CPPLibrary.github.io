# CPPLibrary.github.io
> A web-serivce designed for CS570 team homework #4. Possible enhancments to CPP Library's self checkout system UI.

#### The problem
The unnecessary complexity of the library's self-checkout machines.

#### The Solution 
> The Idea of this web service is to make the self-checkout process as easy as possible, with a minimal interaction between the student and the machine.  
The front main screen of the system is to ask the student to wither swipe their Bronco ID or enter their username and password manually. Next the student can immediately start scanning the ISBNs of the books they’d like to borrow one after the other, no interaction needed after each book. Finally, once the student is done they can click on the ‘Done’ button, the final screen is a screen of they’d like their receipt to be either printed or emailed to them, or no receipt needed at all.
### Preferred Setup for Testing 
Bellow are the setup we used while developing/testing the web service. You will navigate through the website best using;
- Chrome Browser
- 13inch laptop
- Camera permission turned on

### How to use
- Swipe or  Log in manually (username: 123 password 123 )
- Scan books using your laptop camera 
- After finishing scan press done
- Print the recipt, email recipt or no recipt.

#### What to Improve
- A better backend development to connect it with CPP's students DB
-- To add email recipt functionality as well as the Bronco ID/Password
- Adding the swipe device/functionality.
- Stop scanning the same ISBN once added to the list
- Connect the service to CPP Library's ISBN DB
- A better recipt layout
